# We are going to learn how to use random numbers
# We are also learning how to make a small game that will guess the numbers

import os #brings up a bunch of different helpful tools
import random #random is similar and has a lot of different functions
#import brings in a chunk of program that someone else did for us


os.system('cls')

for i in range(10):
    randy = random.randint(3,5)
    print(randy)
